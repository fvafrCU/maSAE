Description: An S4 implementation of the unbiased extension of the model-
    assisted synthetic-regression estimator proposed by Mandallaz (2013), Mandallaz
    et al. (2013) and Mandallaz (2014). It yields smaller variances than the
    standard bias correction, the generalised regression estimator.
